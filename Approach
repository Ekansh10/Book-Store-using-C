USED LL and Arrays (part of problem statement)

As C language lacks OOPs concepts, I've used structures to tackle this problem. (OOPs was a preferable choice as to create a new book object or a new customer object)

Still have'nt completed the efficiency part like using tail pointers for books LL or customer's orders.

There is a Book Store starting pointer 'root' pointing to the LL of books available in the store which can only be manipulated by owner (have'nt added any authentication.)

Then there is Orders array where each element points to the Node of the customer.

Each node of customer structure consists its name, phone and unique ID, and a pointer pointing to the LL of that customer's orders (struct B)
